   freed one by one. As a ring (hv_jit_ring): the region is cut into segments
   filled in turn, and when it fills only the oldest segment is taken back
   (hv_jit_evict_next; the machine drops the blocks in it). Otherwise, or when
   the ring cannot make room, the whole region is reset.

   Two shapes. macOS: one MAP_JIT mapping, made writable per thread while code
   is copied in (rw_diff is 0). iOS: an executable mapping a debugger granted
   (StikDebug or the built-in helper) plus a writable alias of the same pages
   made with vm_remap; code is written through base + rw_diff and runs at base.
   Everything outside this file and the final copy in the translator sees only
   the executable addresses. HV_JIT_SPLIT=1 makes the macOS build use the iOS
   shape, to test it. */
